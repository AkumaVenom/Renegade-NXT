# Player Combat Setup — Automatic Rifle and Pistol

Version 1.3.2 lets the same `Renegade Soldier Combat Component` run either the established automatic AI combat or manual player combat.

## 1. Enable player mode

Add the component to the player Character Blueprint and configure:

- `Player Controlled Combat`: **true**
- `Register As Combat Target`: **true** so hostile GDI/Nod AI can acquire and attack the player
- `Auto Combat Enabled`: ignored while player mode is enabled
- `Team Id`: the player's faction, such as `GDI` or `Nod`

Player mode disables automatic target acquisition, automatic firing, AI combat movement, spline interruption, and target-facing control for that component. Health, damage reception, teams, bullet visuals, ground blood, ragdoll, death, and same-actor respawning remain active.

## 2. Configure both weapons

Under **Renegade NXT > Player Combat > Weapons**, either:

- leave `Use Player Weapon Profiles` disabled and edit `Inline Player Automatic Rifle Settings` plus `Inline Player Pistol Settings`, or
- enable it and assign separate `Renegade Weapon Profile` Data Assets.

Each weapon has independent magazine ammunition. `Current Automatic Rifle Ammo`, `Current Pistol Ammo`, `Current Magazine Ammo`, and `Active Player Weapon` are exposed for UI.

## 3. Enhanced Input connections

The plugin does not force a particular Input Mapping Context, allowing it to work with the project's existing Enhanced Input setup. Connect Input Action events to these component nodes:

### Recommended direct nodes

- Automatic rifle `Started` -> `Player Start Automatic Rifle Fire`
- Automatic rifle `Completed` -> `Player Stop Automatic Rifle Fire`
- Automatic rifle `Canceled` -> `Player Stop Automatic Rifle Fire`
- Pistol `Started` -> `Player Fire Pistol`
- Reload `Started` -> `Player Reload`

### Generic alternative

- `Select Player Automatic Rifle` or `Select Player Pistol`
- `Player Start Fire`
- `Player Stop Fire`
- `Player Fire Once`

The automatic rifle repeats at its configured rounds per minute while held. The pistol convenience node selects the pistol and sends one shot per press.

## 4. Player aim and authoritative shooting

The owning client submits its current controller/camera view ray. The server validates the view origin, aim angle, fire cadence, active weapon, reload state, and ammunition.

The server first traces the camera aim ray, then performs a second trace from the configured muzzle location to that aim point. This prevents a third-person camera from shooting through nearby walls or cover.

Damage is still immediate hitscan. The pooled bullet mesh travels cosmetically from `Bullet Visual Spawn Component` to the confirmed server trace end, and successful combat-character hits use the same ground blood system.

## 5. Muzzle setup

Add a Scene Component to the player Character Blueprint, attach it to the current weapon's muzzle, and assign it to:

`Renegade NXT > Combat Visuals > Bullet Spawn > Bullet Visual Spawn Component`

For separately equipped rifle and pistol actors/components, use `On Player Weapon Changed` to call `Set Bullet Visual Spawn Component` with the newly equipped weapon's muzzle component.

## 6. Weapon and UI events

- `On Player Weapon Changed`: update weapon meshes, Animation Blueprint state, crosshair, and HUD
- `On Player Ammo Changed`: update the correct weapon magazine counter
- `On Shot Fired`: play muzzle flash, firing sound, montage, recoil, and impact effects
- `On Reload Started` / `On Reload Finished`: drive reload animations and HUD state
- `Is Reloading`: query the current reload state

## 7. Player respawn locations

The player uses the same actor after death. Under `Health And Respawn > Respawn`, choose:

- `Original Actor Transform`
- `Random Matching Team Spawn Point`
- `Custom Transform`
- `Custom Transform List`
- `Actor With Respawn Tag`
- `Runtime Transform Override`

Custom lists support First, Random, or Sequential selection. Tagged mode searches level actors carrying `Respawn Actor Tag`, which defaults to `PlayerRespawn`.

Runtime Blueprint nodes:

- `Set Runtime Respawn Transform`
- `Clear Runtime Respawn Transform`
- `Set Custom Respawn Transforms`
- `Add Custom Respawn Transform`
- `Clear Custom Respawn Transforms`

`Respawn Vertical Offset` can lift the capsule above the floor. `Apply Respawn Rotation To Controller` aligns the player's view with the selected spawn transform. `On Respawn Transform Selected` supplies the final transform to Blueprint.

## 8. Multiplayer notes

Player shot requests use an unreliable server RPC so held automatic fire cannot create a delayed reliable-RPC backlog. Weapon switching and reload requests are reliable. The server remains authoritative for cadence, ammo, traces, damage, death, and respawn.

## Built-in keyboard, mouse and gamepad input plus polished aiming (v1.3.2)

Enable `Player Controlled Combat`, then leave `Player Input -> Enable Built-In Input` enabled. The component polls the owning local Player Controller directly, so no Input Action or Mapping Context assets are required.

Default bindings:

- Fire: Left Mouse Button / Gamepad Right Trigger
- Aim: Right Mouse Button / Gamepad Left Trigger
- Reload: R / Gamepad Face Button Left
- Automatic rifle: 1 / Gamepad D-Pad Up
- Pistol: 2 / Gamepad D-Pad Down
- Look: Mouse X/Y / Gamepad Right Stick

Every key, trigger threshold, look sensitivity, gamepad turn speed, dead zone and Y inversion option is exposed under `Player Combat -> Built-In Input`.

Aim presentation is now built into the plugin rather than being only a state/event. While aiming, the component can:

- keep Character yaw aligned to the camera/controller forward direction,
- disable orient-to-movement so strafing does not turn the body away,
- use controller desired rotation and controller yaw,
- smoothly interpolate the selected Camera Component to `Aimed Field Of View`,
- restore the exact original movement flags and FOV on release, death, respawn, or shutdown.

Under `Player Combat -> Aiming`, leave `Enable Aim Presentation`, `Rotate Character To Camera Forward`, and `Zoom Camera While Aiming` enabled. Set `Player Aim Camera Component` when the Character owns multiple cameras; otherwise the plugin auto-finds the active camera and can fall back to PlayerCameraManager.

`On Player Aim Changed` remains available for weapon raise/lower animation, crosshair changes, camera shoulder offsets, and other Blueprint presentation. `Get Player Aim Alpha` supplies a smooth 0-to-1 transition value. Aiming also applies `Aimed Spread Multiplier` to the final player weapon spread.

Disable `Enable Built-In Input` when an existing Enhanced Input Blueprint already calls `Player Start Fire`, `Player Stop Fire`, `Player Set Aiming`, `Player Reload` and the weapon-selection nodes; this prevents duplicate look or fire input.


## Shot hit debugging (v1.3.3)

Under `Combat Visuals > Shot Debug`, enable `Draw Debug Shot Line` to display the exact server-authoritative trace used for damage:

- Green: a combat component was resolved and damage was submitted.
- Orange: the shot hit blocking geometry or a non-hostile/non-combat actor.
- Red: the shot reached maximum range without a blocking hit.

Each player weapon also has `Use Combat Target Object Trace Fallback`, enabled by default, with `Combat Target Object Type` set to `Pawn`. The plugin compares this object trace with the normal weapon-channel trace and keeps the closest hit, so walls still block shots while Character capsules can register even when they do not block Visibility.

## Editing player defaults while player mode is disabled

From v1.3.4 onward, all built-in keyboard, mouse, gamepad, sensitivity, dead-zone, aiming, FOV, rotation, and camera settings remain editable even when `Player Controlled Combat` is disabled. This allows shared parent Character Blueprints to be configured before individual player child classes enable player mode. The Boolean still controls runtime activation.
